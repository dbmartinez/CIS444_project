    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <p>
        To understand what makes our brewery truly special, you first have to understand how we started: a group of 5 
        friends <br>with thier love of anime and beer, came up with a remarkable idea. And turned their passion into something 
        they all love,<br> with the groups passion and their insatiable curiosity that led them to open a brewery, build a 
        team of world-class like-minded <br>brewers and eventually earn the title of Master Anime Brewer. Our unique style is
        something San Diego has beem craving <br>for, a brewery with style and great taste. Also not to mention the great food
        that we have to offer as well. This unique combination of <br>unwavering creativity, unquestionable expertise, and 
        relentless innovation, drive us to craft beers that <br>quite frankly, might change the way you think about beer.
